Configuration
=============

The default settings generate the most commonly-used URL pattern: if you have a resource at ``_static/js/logic.js`` and you generate a 404 page with the default settings, the URL for that resource will be ``/en/latest/_static/js/logic.js``.

For other use cases, you can customize these configuration options in your ``conf.py`` file:

.. confval:: notfound_template

   Template used to render the ``404.html`` generated by this extension.

   Default: ``'page.html'``

   Type: string

.. confval:: notfound_context

   Context passed to the template defined by ``notfound_template``.

   Default: ``{'title': 'Page not found', 'body': '<h1>Page not found</h1>\n\nThanks for trying.'}``

   Type: dict

   Notes: If you prefer, you can create a file called ``404.rst`` and use reStructuredText to create the context of your ``404.html`` page.

.. confval:: notfound_pagename

   Page name generated by the extension.

   Default: ``'404'``

   Type: string

.. confval:: notfound_default_language

   Language used as default to generate all links to the resources.

   Default: ``'en'``

   Type: string

   Notes: All links generated will have this prefix (e.g. ``/en/``).
   This setting works with ``notfound_default_version`` to create a prefix for all URLs.

.. confval:: notfound_default_version

   Version used as default to generate all links to the resources.

   Default: ``'latest'``

   Type: string

   Notes: All links generated will have this prefix (e.g. ``/latest/``).
   This setting works with ``notfound_default_language`` to create a prefix for all URLs.

.. confval:: notfound_no_urls_prefix

   URL prefixes skipped or included.

   Default: ``False``.

   Type: bool

   Notes: If this option is set to ``True``, the extension omits any prefix values from the URLs, including explicit values for ``notfound_default_language`` and ``notfound_default_version``.

.. confval:: notfound_url_prefix

   Global URL prefix to be included as is (for ex. set ``/REPO_NAME`` to host on github pages with address YOUR_NAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/).

   Default: `` `` (empty).

   Type: string

   Notes: this prefix will be included as is before anything else.
